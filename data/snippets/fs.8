# Paths specified using a Buffer are useful primarily on certain POSIX operating systems that treat file paths as opaque byte sequences. On such systems, it is possible for a single file path to contain sub-sequences that use multiple character encodings. As with string paths, Buffer paths may be relative or absolute:

# Example using an absolute path on POSIX:

fs.open(Buffer.from('/open/some/file.txt'), 'r', (err, fd) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  fs.close(fd, (err) => {
    if (err) throw err;
  });
});
